In addition to what's in Anaconda, this lecture will need the following libraries:

.. code-block:: ipython
  :class: hide-output

  !pip install --upgrade quantecon
  !pip install interpolation

Overview
============

We solved the stochastic optimal growth model using

#. :doc:`value function iteration <optgrowth>`
#. :doc:`Euler equation based time iteration <coleman_policy_iter>`

We found time iteration to be significantly more accurate at each step.

In this lecture, we'll look at an ingenious twist on the time iteration technique called the **endogenous grid method** (EGM).

EGM is a numerical method for implementing policy iteration invented by `Chris Carroll <http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/>`__.

It is a good example of how a clever algorithm can save a massive amount of computer time.

(Massive when we multiply saved CPU cycles on each implementation times the number of implementations worldwide)

The original reference is :cite:`Carroll2006`.

Let's start with some standard imports:

.. code-block:: ipython

    import numpy as np
    import quantecon as qe
    from interpolation import interp
    from numba import njit, prange
    from quantecon.optimize import brentq
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline


Key Idea
==========================

Let's start by reminding ourselves of the theory and then see how the numerics fit in.



Theory
------

Take the model set out in :doc:`the time iteration lecture <coleman_policy_iter>`, following the same terminology and notation.

The Euler equation is

.. math::
    :label: egm_euler

    (u'\circ \sigma^*)(y)
    = \beta \int (u'\circ \sigma^*)(f(y - \sigma^*(y)) z) f'(y - \sigma^*(y)) z \phi(dz)


As we saw, the Coleman-Reffett operator is a nonlinear operator :math:`K` engineered so that :math:`\sigma^*` is a fixed point of :math:`K`.

It takes as its argument a continuous strictly increasing consumption policy :math:`\sigma \in \Sigma`.

It returns a new function :math:`K \sigma`,  where :math:`(K \sigma)(y)` is the :math:`c \in (0, \infty)` that solves

.. math::
    :label: egm_coledef

    u'(c)
    = \beta \int (u' \circ \sigma) (f(y - c) z ) f'(y - c) z \phi(dz)




Exogenous Grid
-------------------

As discussed in :doc:`the lecture on time iteration <coleman_policy_iter>`, to implement the method on a computer we need a numerical approximation.

In particular, we represent a policy function by a set of values on a finite grid.

The function itself is reconstructed from this representation when necessary, using interpolation or some other method.

:doc:`Previously <coleman_policy_iter>`, to obtain a finite representation of an updated consumption policy we

* fixed a grid of income points :math:`\{y_i\}`

* calculated the consumption value :math:`c_i` corresponding to each
  :math:`y_i` using :eq:`egm_coledef` and a root-finding routine

Each :math:`c_i` is then interpreted as the value of the function :math:`K \sigma` at :math:`y_i`.

Thus, with the points :math:`\{y_i, c_i\}` in hand, we can reconstruct :math:`K \sigma` via approximation.

Iteration then continues...




Endogenous Grid
--------------------

The method discussed above requires a root-finding routine to find the
:math:`c_i` corresponding to a given income value :math:`y_i`.

Root-finding is costly because it typically involves a significant number of
function evaluations.

As pointed out by Carroll :cite:`Carroll2006`, we can avoid this if
:math:`y_i` is chosen endogenously.

The only assumption required is that :math:`u'` is invertible on :math:`(0, \infty)`.

The idea is this:

First, we fix an *exogenous* grid :math:`\{k_i\}` for capital (:math:`k = y - c`).

Then we obtain  :math:`c_i` via

.. math::
    :label: egm_getc

    c_i =
    (u')^{-1}
    \left\{
        \beta \int (u' \circ \sigma) (f(k_i) z ) \, f'(k_i) \, z \, \phi(dz)
    \right\}

where :math:`(u')^{-1}` is the inverse function of :math:`u'`.

Finally, for each :math:`c_i` we set :math:`y_i = c_i + k_i`.

It is clear that each :math:`(y_i, c_i)` pair constructed in this manner satisfies :eq:`egm_coledef`.

With the points :math:`\{y_i, c_i\}` in hand, we can reconstruct :math:`K \sigma` via approximation as before.

The name EGM comes from the fact that the grid :math:`\{y_i\}` is  determined **endogenously**.


Implementation
================

Let's implement this version of the Coleman-Reffett operator and see how it performs.

First, we will construct a class ``OptimalGrowthModel`` to hold the parameters of the
model.


.. code-block:: python3

    class OptimalGrowthModel:

        """

        The class holds parameters and true value and policy functions.
        """

        def __init__(self,
                     f,                # Production function
                     f_prime,          # f'(k)
                     u,                # Utility function
                     u_prime,          # Marginal utility
                     u_prime_inv,      # Inverse marginal utility
                     β=0.96,           # Discount factor
                     μ=0,
                     s=0.1,
                     grid_max=4,
                     grid_size=200,
                     shock_size=250):

            self.β, self.μ, self.s = β, μ, s
            self.f, self.u = f, u
            self.f_prime, self.u_prime, self.u_prime_inv = f_prime, u_prime, \
                u_prime_inv

            # Set up grid
            self.grid = np.linspace(1e-5, grid_max, grid_size)
            # Store shocks
            self.shocks = np.exp(μ + s * np.random.randn(shock_size))


The Operator
----------------


Here's an implementation of :math:`K` using EGM as described above.

Unlike the :doc:`previous lecture <coleman_policy_iter>`, we do not just-in-time
compile the operator because we want to return the policy function.

Despite this, the EGM method is still faster than the standard Coleman-Reffett operator,
as we will see later on.

.. code-block:: python3

    def egm_operator_factory(og):
        """
        A function factory for building the Coleman-Reffett operator

        Here og is an instance of OptimalGrowthModel.
        """

        f, u, β = og.f, og.u, og.β
        f_prime, u_prime, u_prime_inv = og.f_prime, og.u_prime, og.u_prime_inv
        grid, shocks = og.grid, og.shocks

        def K(σ):
            """
            The Bellman operator

            * σ is a function
            """
            # Allocate memory for value of consumption on endogenous grid points
            c = np.empty_like(grid)

            # Solve for updated consumption value
            for i, k in enumerate(grid):
                vals = u_prime(σ(f(k) * shocks)) * f_prime(k) * shocks
                c[i] = u_prime_inv(β * np.mean(vals))

            # Determine endogenous grid
            y = grid + c  # y_i = k_i + c_i

            # Update policy function and return
            σ_new = lambda x: interp(y, c, x)

            return σ_new

        return K

Note the lack of any root-finding algorithm.

We'll also run our original implementation, which uses an exogenous grid and requires root-finding, so we can perform some comparisons.

.. literalinclude:: /_static/lecture_specific/coleman_policy_iter/coleman_operator.py



Let's test out the code above on some example parameterizations.


Testing on the Log / Cobb--Douglas Case
------------------------------------------


As we :doc:`did for value function iteration <optgrowth>` and :doc:`time iteration <coleman_policy_iter>`,
let's start by testing our method with the log-linear benchmark.


First, we generate an instance


.. code-block:: python3

    α = 0.4  # Production function parameter

    @njit
    def f(k):
        """
        Cobb-Douglas production function
        """
        return k**α

    @njit
    def f_prime(k):
        """
        First derivative of the production function
        """
        return α * k**(α - 1)

    @njit
    def u_prime(c):
        return 1 / c

    og = OptimalGrowthModel(f=f,
                            f_prime=f_prime,
                            u=np.log,
                            u_prime=u_prime,
                            u_prime_inv=u_prime)

Notice that we're passing ``u_prime`` twice.

The reason is that, in the case of log utility, :math:`u'(c) = (u')^{-1}(c) = 1/c`.

Hence ``u_prime`` and ``u_prime_inv`` are the same.

As a preliminary test, let's see if :math:`K \sigma^* = \sigma^*`, as implied by the theory


.. code-block:: python3

    β, grid = og.β, og.grid

    def c_star(y):
        "True optimal policy"
        return (1 - α * β) * y

    K = egm_operator_factory(og)  # Return the operator K with endogenous grid

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9, 6))

    ax.plot(grid, c_star(grid), label="optimal policy $\sigma^*$")
    ax.plot(grid, K(c_star)(grid), label="$K\sigma^*$")

    ax.legend()
    plt.show()


We can't really distinguish the two plots.

In fact it's easy to see that the difference is essentially zero:

.. code-block:: python3

    max(abs(K(c_star)(grid) - c_star(grid)))


Next, let's try iterating from an arbitrary initial condition and see if we
converge towards :math:`\sigma^*`.


Let's start from the consumption policy that eats the whole pie: :math:`\sigma(y) = y`



.. code-block:: python3

    σ = lambda x: x
    n = 15
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9, 6))

    ax.plot(grid, σ(grid), color=plt.cm.jet(0),
            alpha=0.6, label='initial condition $\sigma(y) = y$')

    for i in range(n):
        σ = K(σ)  # Update policy
        ax.plot(grid, σ(grid), color=plt.cm.jet(i / n),  alpha=0.6)

    ax.plot(grid, c_star(grid), 'k-',
            alpha=0.8, label='true policy function $\sigma^*$')

    ax.legend()
    plt.show()



We see that the policy has converged nicely, in only a few steps.


Speed
========

Now let's compare the clock times per iteration for the standard Coleman-Reffett
operator (with exogenous grid) and the EGM version.

We'll do so using the CRRA model adopted in the exercises of the :doc:`Euler equation time iteration lecture <coleman_policy_iter>`.

.. code-block:: python3

    γ = 1.5   # Preference parameter

    @njit
    def u(c):
        return (c**(1 - γ) - 1) / (1 - γ)

    @njit
    def u_prime(c):
        return c**(-γ)

    @njit
    def u_prime_inv(c):
        return c**(-1 / γ)

    og = OptimalGrowthModel(f=f,
                            f_prime=f_prime,
                            u=u,
                            u_prime=u_prime,
                            u_prime_inv=u_prime_inv)

    # Standard Coleman-Reffett operator
    K_time = time_operator_factory(og)
    # Call once to compile jitted version
    K_time(grid)
    # Coleman-Reffett operator with endogenous grid
    K_egm = egm_operator_factory(og)


Here's the result


.. code-block:: python3

    sim_length = 20

    print("Timing standard Coleman policy function iteration")
    σ = grid    # Initial policy
    qe.util.tic()
    for i in range(sim_length):
        σ_new = K_time(σ)
        σ = σ_new
    qe.util.toc()

    print("Timing policy function iteration with endogenous grid")
    σ = lambda x: x  # Initial policy
    qe.util.tic()
    for i in range(sim_length):
        σ_new = K_egm(σ)
        σ = σ_new
    qe.util.toc()


We see that the EGM version is significantly faster, even without jit compilation!

The absence of numerical root-finding means that it is typically more accurate at each step as well.
